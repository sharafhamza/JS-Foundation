# How JavaScript code is being executed

1. **Parsing**: Converts code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
2. **Memory Allocation**: Variables and function declarations are hoisted and allocated in memory.
3. **Execution Context**: The code starts running in the context of its execution environment (scope).
4. **JIT Compilation**: Frequently used code is compiled into machine code for faster execution.
5. **Execution**: The code is executed (interpreted or compiled machine code).
6. **Garbage Collection**: Memory is cleaned when no longer used.Here is my code about my practice
