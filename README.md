# How JavaScript code is being executed?

1. **Parsing**: Converts code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
2. 
3. **Memory Allocation**: Variables and function declarations are hoisted and allocated in memory.
4. 
5. **Execution Context**: The code starts running in the context of its execution environment (scope).
6.

8. 
9. **Execution**: The code is executed (interpreted or compiled machine code).
10. 
11. **Garbage Collection**: Memory is cleaned when no longer used.Here is my code about my practice
